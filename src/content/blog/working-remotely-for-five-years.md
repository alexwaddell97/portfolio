I've been fully remote since 2020, and like most people who went remote during the pandemic, I've had time to form actual opinions rather than just novelty reactions.

The honest version: it's the best working arrangement I've had, and there are days where I genuinely struggle with it.

The good is well-documented. No commute. Flexibility to structure your day around your energy levels. The ability to do deep work without a constant stream of interruptions. I write better code at home than I ever did in an open-plan office.

What's less discussed is the social infrastructure you lose. In an office, you pick up context passively — overhearing conversations, noticing when a colleague looks stressed before a deadline, the informal check-ins by the coffee machine. Remote work demands you rebuild all of that infrastructure deliberately. If you don't, you end up isolated in a way that sneaks up on you.

The practices that have helped me most: a daily 15-minute sync with my closest collaborator (not a standup — an actual conversation), being aggressive about over-communicating in writing, and treating my local coffee shop as a genuine office two days a week.

The other thing nobody warns you about is how your relationship with work changes when it lives in the same building as you. The commute, as annoying as it is, creates a transition ritual. Without it, work expands to fill whatever space you give it. You have to build your own rituals: a specific chair, a specific playlist, a deliberate close-of-day action that signals the end of the working day to your brain.

Five years in, I'd find it very difficult to go back. But I've also stopped pretending it's universally perfect.
