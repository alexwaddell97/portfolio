  agency roles. This post walks through that path, why agencies were valuable to
  my growth, the practical differences between running a small company and being

description: Reflections on transitioning from running my own company after uni
  to working in agencies — lessons, expectations, and practical advice for
  UK-based early-career devs.

## Timeline (short)

* Leaving university → started my own company (2019, Sicarius)
* Early client work and learning (scope, scale, mistakes)
* First agency role (what drew me in)
* Subsequent moves and the present

## From running my own company to agencies

Running a company straight out of uni taught me how to ship, talk to clients, and handle the messy bits — contracts, scope creep, and delivery pressure. Agencies, by contrast, exposed me to larger teams, more formal processes, and a breadth of domains.

I found these differences particularly useful:

* Team structure: distributed responsibilities vs. wearing all the hats
* Delivery cadence: agency sprints, stakeholder comms, and handoffs
* Quality & craft: stronger emphasis on reusable components, design systems, and maintainability

## Key lessons

* Learn to communicate technical trade-offs clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
* Processes are a feature — they keep things shipped at scale.
* Focus on craft early: tests, accessibility, and consistent patterns pay off.
* Be deliberate about what you take from each role: skills, network, reputation.

## Practical advice for others (UK-based early-career devs)

* When joining an agency, ask about onboarding, mentoring and tech debt practices.
* Keep a log of wins and decisions — they make CVs and interviews much easier.
* If you’ve run a business, frame it as product/people/process experience, not just “freelance”.

## Closing

This is a first draft — I can expand any section with anecdotes (client stories, tough decisions, interview takeaways), add links to projects from my CV, or rework tone for a particular audience (mentoring, junior devs, or hiring managers). Tell me which parts you'd like me to expand and any specific dates, company names, or stories to include.
