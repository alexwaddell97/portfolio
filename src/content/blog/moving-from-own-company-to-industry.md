## The awkward first week

I still remember the first Monday after handing over the last of my invoices: I
showed up on time, made a proper cup of tea, and nearly apologised for not
wearing five different hats at once. It felt weird to focus on one thing and
leave someone else to worry about the fonts in the invoice template.

Moving from running my own company into industry isn't a single dramatic
moment — it's a series of smaller, quietly powerful changes. If you grew up
shipping everything yourself, the trade-offs can feel like luxury at first.

## What changed (the practical stuff)

- Team boundaries: Instead of being the person responsible for everything, I
  joined a team where responsibilities were shared. That didn't mean fewer
  problems — just fewer evenings spent debugging billing systems at midnight.

- Predictable cadence: Industry brought regular releases, sprint planning, and
  clearer acceptance criteria. Deadlines were still real, but they came with
  clearer expectations and handoffs.

- Mentorship and feedback loops: Working alongside senior engineers and
  product people gave me structured feedback I hadn't really experienced as an
  owner — and that accelerated my craft.

- Scale without solo risk: On my own, every misstep landed on me. In a bigger
  team, mistakes are collective and recoverable, so you're free to try bolder
  approaches without betting the company on them.

## The benefits (the headline wins)

- Focus on craft, not survival: I could spend time improving code quality,
  testing, and performance because I wasn't simultaneously chasing new clients
  or writing proposals at midnight.

- Psychological bandwidth: Knowing payroll and office logistics weren't *my*
  emergency made it easier to focus on long-term problems instead of reactive
  firefights.

- Career scaffolding: Progression, reviews, and clearer growth pathways helped
  me level up faster than ad-hoc mentorship and hope.

- Better tooling and investment: Companies often have the budget (and patience)
  for CI, observability, UX research, and training — things that pay compound
  interest in developer productivity.

## The things I missed (and why they matter)

- Autonomy and speed: Running a company lets you move fast, hire weird people,
  and make gambles. In industry, decisions are more deliberate — which is good
  — but sometimes you miss the joy of improvised wins.

- Wearing many hats: I learned a lot by doing sales, contracts, support, and
  design. Those lessons are valuable and translate to empathetic product
  thinking.

## A few surprising wins I didn't expect

- The value of process: I used to think processes were corporate glue that
  slowed creativity. Turns out, the right processes let creativity scale. A
  good review checklist or release template saves more time than it costs.

- Relearning patience: Product decisions in larger organisations can be slow,
  but they often come from durable thinking. Learning to be patient with that
  process improved my product judgement.

- Better work/life boundaries: With someone else responsible for payroll and
  client chasing, evenings became mine again — I didn't realise how exhausted
  I was until I had days without constant context switching.

## Practical advice if you're making the move

- Treat past solo work as evidence of responsibility, not a weakness. Frame
  it as product, people and process experience.

- Ask about onboarding, mentorship, and decision-making processes in interviews
  — they matter more than the job title.

- Keep a learning log: note decisions, trade-offs, and outcomes. It makes annual
  reviews and career moves far easier.

- Preserve a bit of scrappiness: The ability to move quickly and prototype is
  still valuable. Use it inside the org when appropriate.

## A closing anecdote (short)

A few months in, my manager asked how I liked having a dedicated design team.
I said, "It feels like discovering someone else did my washing up and also
left the house smelling faintly of coffee." They laughed; I realised the
joke was that both the washing up and the coffee made life measurably better.

## Final thoughts

Moving from your own company into industry isn't a surrender — it's a
re-allocation of attention. You trade some autonomy for stability, but you get
back time, mentorship, and the chance to ship higher-leverage work with a
team. For me, it meant swapping frantic multitasking for fewer, deeper wins.

If you'd like, I can:

- Tighten the tone (more formal or more casual)
- Add specific anecdotes or company names
- Format this for the site with links to projects from my CV

Tell me which of those you'd like and I'll update the draft.
